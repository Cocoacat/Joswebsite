            I had been severely suffering with pain and tension in my neck and upper shoulder area, which seemed to cause me a lot of headaches. A friend recommended Jo for Indian Head Massage. I was hesitant as i didn't think anything would get rid of my headaaches, but I thought I'd try it so I booked a treatment. I am so glad I did, after 6 treatments I can now say that the pain and headaches have gone, and I now have regular treatments to keep my headaches from returning. Thanks Jo.
