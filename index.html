                 <h1><strong>CANCELLATION POLICY</strong></h1>
<h3><p>In order to minimize disruptions to our schedule, we require 24 hours notice to change, cancel and/or reschedule Therapy appointments. If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay a 50% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied.</p><p>Cancellation of block bookings is only possible within 24 hrs, a gift voucher will be offered for the amount paid.</p><p>

Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.</p><p>

Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that our therapists are compensated for their time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts our therapists who only get paid when they deliver a treatment, but also affects our clients.</p><p> Please be courteous to your therapist and other clients by respecting our policies.</p></h3>

            I had been severely suffering with pain and tension in my neck and upper shoulder area, which seemed to cause me a lot of headaches. A friend recommended Jo for Indian Head Massage. I was hesitant as i didn't think anything would get rid of my headaaches, but I thought I'd try it so I booked a treatment. I am so glad I did, after 6 treatments I can now say that the pain and headaches have gone, and I now have regular treatments to keep my headaches from returning. Thanks Jo.

                We have an exciting treatment which has arrived!! The term tui na (pronounced "twee naw"), which literally means "pinch and pull," refers to a wide range of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapeutic massage and body work. Tui na is not generally used for pleasure and relaxation, but rather as a treatment to address specific patterns of disharmony.
