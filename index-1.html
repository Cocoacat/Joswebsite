          Traditional, or Swedish Massage is the most popular Western massage. Its purpose is to relax the entire body, but it also has a number of other health benefits.  Swedish massage improves blood circulation, increases the level of oxygen in the blood, helps the body to remove toxins, improves flexibility, eases tension and stress and helps with pain management.

            This massage aims to reduce muscle tension, joint stiffness and chronic pain. It targets connective tissue that may have formed into stubborn, fibrous knots and stimulates and conditions the muscular system. A great remedial massage treatment which as the name suggests really gets in there and is quite intense, leaving you lighter and relaxed to cope with the world.

             Hot Stone massage therapy can be likened to having a hot bath without getting wet, or burying your feet in warm sand. It’s a lovely way to de-stress and creates a sense of deep relaxation.Hot stones will be placed on you to warm muscles and you will then be massaged with hot stones in order to break down tension and relieve aches and pains. A wonderfully warming massage.

            A stress-busting relaxing massage for the upper back, neck, shoulders, arms, hands and face, as well as the head. Indian Head Massage has been performed in India in families for generations and was called Champi (the origin of the word shampoo). Herbs and spices were often added to the oils to give an overall therapeutic effect to the treatment. Today it has been adapted to help with many of the health issues arising in our Western Civilisation.

By concentrating on various pressure points and massage techniques to improve circulation.

            <div class="text1"><a href="index-2.html#Aromatherapy_Treatments">Aromatherapy</a></div>
           One of the most popular ways to use aromatherapy is through a massage. The essential oils are added to a carrier oil to dilute the mixture and are then massaged into the skin. An aromatherapy massage usually lasts between one hour and 90 minutes. This will be tailored to suit your specific requirements. Aromatherapy massages are incredibly relaxing. They give you the opportunity to reap the benefits of both aromatherapy and massage. Aromatherapy massage and essential oil blends are adapted to suit the needs of the client.

            Massage Therapists can easily combine Quantum-Breath with their massage work. Sometimes energy can work at a greater depth than massage work, especially if the client is injured. Because energy healing uses a light touch, (and sometimes no touch) energy healing can also be applied where massage work may be contraindicated. Also, massage therapists can use energy healing during the massage to increase the therapeutic work of the massage and allow the client to go into deep states of relaxation and connection.

            The Natural Face Lift Massage (or Facial Rejuvenation) is a combination of Indian Face Massage, healing techniques including acupressure and lymphatic drainage, on the face and neck. This very relaxing treatment is perfectly developed to tackle the stresses and strains of our modern, fast-paced lives, working specifically on the lines and wrinkles that can give you that tired look. Using only the fingers, the Natural Face Lift Massage helps to pull up the skin, relax tense muscles that create and deepen lines on the face and bring back a healthy glow.
